## ðŸ›  Shopify vs. React: Key Comparisons

| **Shopify (Liquid & Sections)** | **React (Components & Props)** |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Sections** â†’ Think of these like **React components**. They define reusable UI blocks with settings. | **Components** â†’ Self-contained UI elements that can be reused and accept props. |
| **Blocks** â†’ Nested inside sections, similar to dynamic child components in React. | **Children Props** â†’ React components can render dynamic child elements. |
| **Snippets** â†’ Small reusable Liquid templates (like helper functions in React). | **Custom Hooks** â†’ Encapsulate reusable logic in React. |
| **Schema Settings** â†’ JSON-based config inside a section for customizing appearance and content. | **Props & State** â†’ Props pass data to components; state manages component behavior. |
| **Metafields** â†’ Store additional product or page data, similar to API responses in React. | **API Calls & Context** â†’ Use API requests or React Context to manage extra data. |
| **Liquid Loops (`{% for product in collections %}`)** â†’ Iterates over arrays. | **`.map()` Method** â†’ Used in React to loop through arrays. |
| **AJAX API** â†’ Used for fetching and updating cart items dynamically. | **Fetch API/Axios** â†’ Handles API requests for data fetching. |
